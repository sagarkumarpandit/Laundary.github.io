    <h3>D> Introduction:</h3>
    <p>
        Laundry refers to the washing of clothing and other textiles. And more broadly, their drying and ironing as well as Laundry has been part of history since humans began to wear clothes, so the methods by which different cultures have dealt with this universal human need are of interest to several branches of scholarship. Laundry work has traditionally been highly gendered with the responsibility in most cultures falling to women (formerly known as laundresses or washerman). The industrial revolution gradually led to mechanized solutions to laundry work, notably the washing machine and later the tumble dryer. Laundry like cooking and childcare is still done both at home and by commercial establishments outside the home. The word “laundry” may refer to the clothing itself or to the place where the cleaning happens, An individual home may have a laundry room a utility room includes but is not restricted to the function of washing  clothes and the problems of college hostelers are often to face difficulties in managing their cloth laundry due to various factors in way first of all they have absence of time due to their educational related works , classes and social life since they are unable to clean their clothes.

        <h3>F> proposed  solution :</h3>
    <p>
        One possible solution is the development of a laundry management app or platform that integrates with college campus resources and provides guidance and support for students in managing their laundry needs.
    Laundry processes
    
    Laundry processes include washing (usually with water containing detergents or other chemicals), agitation, rinsing, drying, pressing (ironing), and folding. The washing will sometimes be done at a temperature above room temperature to increase the activities of any chemicals used and the solubility of stains, and high temperatures kill micro-organisms that may be present on the fabric. However, it is advised that cotton be washed at a cooler temperature to prevent shrinking. Many professional laundry services are present in the market which offers at different price range.
    
    Agitation helps remove dirt which is usually mobilised by surfactants from between fibres, however, due to the small size of the pores in fibres, the 'stagnant core' of the fibres themselves see virtually no flow. The fibres are nevertheless rapidly cleaned by diffusion  carrying dirt out into the clean water during the rinsing process.
    
    Chemicals
    Various chemicals may be used to increase the solvent power of water, such as the compounds in soaproot or yucca-root used by Native American tribes, or the ash lye (usually sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide) once widely used for soaking laundry in Europe. Soap, a compound made from lye and fat, is an ancient and common laundry aid. Modern washing machines typically use synthetic powdered or liquid laundry detergent in place of more traditional soap.
    
    Cleaning or dry cleaning
    Main article: Dry cleaning
    
    Many dry cleaners place cleaned clothes inside thin clear plastic garment bags.
    Dry cleaning refers to any process which uses a chemical solvent other than water. The solvent used is typically tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene), which the industry calls "perc". It is used to clean delicate fabrics that cannot withstand the rough and tumble of a washing machine and clothes dryer; it can also obviate labour-intensive hand washing.

    <h3>g>Result/Expected Outcome</h3>
    <p>
        One possible solution is the development of a                  laundry management app or platform.
        According to our view our project will definitely stand on our motto. we provide cheap rate for customer with respect to other that’s result will be many customers will come our shop and we will earn more profit respect to other . we provide best quality work regarding laundry that’s result many people will be attract towards our service. Then that is good achievement for us and our customer ratings will be growth than other that’s will my first impression for starting phase that’s will enough for us . according to my thinking “more customer more profit”. We will give offer on time to time for customer . on 10 clothes in one time to give on my shop then 1 cloth price will be not taken. That’s  way we will one time accumulate at a time more clothes and we get earn more profit. We will deliver the clothes free of cost that’s way customer is more attract for this service. We see other shop will be not provided free of cost deliver service. That is more innovative and unique services which is begin by us. Therefore customers are happy to our service.
